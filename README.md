This year we are making the JS Kongress to the place for the JavaScript language interested people, the experts and core team members of different frameworks, tools and engines to discuss the Future of the language JavaScript. The overall idea is to have a creative space, to share ideas, work together, discuss and listen to others - face to face. JS Kongress provides just enough structure to empower attendees to share their expertise. This gives our participants the opportunity to have an unfiltered exchange of innovative ideas. The In-Deep Track is all about **sharing knowledge, discussing and working around the Future of JavaScript** (which also **includes WebAssembly and Tooling**) and having fun with like-minded people in a safe environment.

## Who is it for? What's the plan?

**We invite everyone** who wants to contribute to join us at the JS Kongress in Munich (Nov 13-14). We plan to do a **second track** (besides the [main track](https://2017.js-kongress.de/schedule-js-kongress-2017/)) in an unconference style with round tables and office hours (see [conceptual explanation](#conceptual-explanation)) on all kinds of topics around the future of JavaScript (which also includes WebAssembly and Tooling). Everyone can propose a topic related session whatever topic they’d like to discuss with other developers, experts and users. **Who already confirmed to come?**

## How to contribute

Unlike traditional conferences as it is on the main track, the schedule for the the In-Deep Slot is decided and created by the participants. Before the conference days everybody is invited to introduce his session on [our github repository](https://github.com/JSKongress/JS-Kongress-Munich-In-Deep-Track/issues). **For submitting your contribution open a new issue at the [JS Kongress Github Repository](https://github.com/JSKongress/JS-Kongress-Munich-In-Deep-Track/issues).** The idea is to give an introduction about your topic, tell the people about what they can expect and have a place for communication about the topic before, during and after the conference.

## Session format

We strive for interactive sessions. Contributions where you want to discuss, where you want to work with others together, where you want feedback for are gladly seen. The final format is depending on the contributors wish and the number of participants to the individual proposals. This could be an unconference with a lot participants or round tables and office hours with less participants. **The topics already submitted can be used for orientation:**

**Note:** This is not a CFP, everybody from the community who owns a ticket has the opportunity to contribute to the In-Deep Slot.

## Location

On both days of the JS Kongress we have reserved the west part of the [Alte Kongresshalle](https://2017.js-kongress.de/venue/), the so called flat construction. There we have different rooms with different capacities. Based on the number of interests and participants the format and rooms will be assigned.

### Conceptual explanation

_For getting a common understanding about the topics “Unconference”, “Round Tables”, “Office hours”_ **Unconference** <span style="font-weight: 400;">An unconference is a participant-driven meeting. The agenda is created by the attendees at the beginning of the meeting. Anyone who wants to initiate a discussion on a topic can claim a time and a space. Unconferences typically feature open discussions rather than having a single speaker at the front of the room giving a talk, although any format is permitted. The participants pitch their topic ideas and define the schedule based on their interests. A facilitator will guide through the whole process.</span> **Round Tables** Round table is a form of academic discussion. Participants agree on a specific topic to discuss and debate. It’s common to define timeboxes for that. Each person is given equal right to participate, as illustrated by the idea of a circular layout referred to in the term round table. **Office Hours** At Office Hours you’ll find experts and speakers ready to chat, help you with projects and answer questions. This is a timeboxed format. E.g. 1h per speaker/expert.
